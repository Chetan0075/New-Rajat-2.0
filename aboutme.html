                <div>Hey there, I'm Rajat Wankhade, known as rajatwankhade007 across social media platforms. A
                    passionate Fashion Model, Engineer, and Content Creator, I've found my calling in the diverse worlds
                    of fashion, technology, and creative expression.<br><br>Originally from Yavatmal, with a heart
                    deeply rooted in Pune, I've built my life around the things I love most. My journey began on
                    November 13th, a day that marked not just my birth but the start of a path filled with determination
                    and dreams.<br><br>One of my proudest moments was being crowned Mr. Amravati in 2018, a testament to
                    my dedication to the craft of modeling and the art of self-expression. The following year, I
                    clinched the title of Mr. Maharashtra Glam in 2019, further solidifying my place in the fashion
                    scene.<br><br>Beyond the glitz and glamour of the runway, I'm also a dedicated engineer, constantly
                    exploring the latest technologies and pushing the boundaries of innovation. This dual identity fuels
                    my creativity, blending the worlds of style and substance seamlessly.<br><br>When I'm not striking a
                    pose or diving into code, you can find me behind the lens, capturing moments and weaving stories
                    through my content. Whether it's through fashion shoots, tech reviews, or vlogs documenting my
                    adventures, I'm always striving to inspire and entertain my audience.<br><br>Join me on this
                    exhilarating journey as I continue to embrace the beauty of diversity, chase my passions, and leave
                    a lasting impact on the world, one runway strut at a time.</div>
